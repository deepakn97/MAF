We know that Edmund uses 18 inches of gift wrapper per gift box and on average, Tom sells 2 boxes every day. So, 18 inches/gift box * 2 gift boxes = 36 inches of gift wrapper are used per 2 boxes. Therefore, 90 inches / 36 inches/gift box = 2.5 gift boxes can be wrapped with 90 inches of gift wrapper per day.
