The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the human\\'s questions.\\n### Human: What are the key differences between renewable and non-renewable energy sources?\\n### Assistant: Renewable energy sources are those that can be replenished naturally in a relatively short amount of time, such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass. Non-renewable energy sources, on the other hand, are finite and will eventually be depleted, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Here are some key differences between renewable and non-renewable energy sources:\\n1. Availability: Renewable energy sources are virtually inexhaustible, while non-renewable energy sources are finite and will eventually run out.\\n2. Environmental impact: Renewable energy sources have a much lower environmental impact than non-renewable sources, which can lead to air and water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and other negative effects.\\n3. Cost: Renewable energy sources can be more expensive to initially set up, but they typically have lower operational costs than non-renewable sources.\\n4. Reliability: Renewable energy sources are often more reliable and can be used in more remote locations than non-renewable sources.\\n5. Flexibility: Renewable energy sources are often more flexible and can be adapted to different situations and needs, while non-renewable sources are more rigid and inflexible.\\n6. Sustainability: Renewable energy sources are more sustainable over the long term, while non-renewable sources are not, and their depletion can lead to economic and social instability.\\n### Human: Let\\'s think step by step.
