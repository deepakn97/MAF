Passage: The French king, John II, had been held captive in England. The Treaty of Brétigny set his ransom at 3 million crowns and allowed for hostages to be held in lieu of John. The hostages included two of his sons, several princes and nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France. While these hostages were held, John returned to France to try and raise funds to pay the ransom. In 1362 John's son Louis of Anjou, a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped captivity. So, with his stand-in hostage gone, John felt honor-bound to return to captivity in England. The French crown had been at odds with Navarre  since 1354, and in 1363 the Navarrese used the captivity of John II in London and the political weakness of the Dauphin to try to seize power. Although there was no formal treaty, Edward III supported the Navarrese moves, particularly as there was a prospect that he might gain control over the northern and western provinces as a consequence. With this in mind, Edward deliberately slowed the peace negotiations. In 1364, John II died in London, while still in honourable captivity. Charles V succeeded him as king of France. On 7 May 1364, one month after the dauphin's accession and three days before his coronation as Charles V, the Navarrese suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Cocherel.

Question: How many groups were held hostage in lieu of John II?

Answer: The Treaty of Brétigny set John II's ransom at 3 million crowns and allowed for hostages to be held in lieu of him. The hostages included two of his sons, several princes and nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France. Thus, there were a total of twenty-four groups held hostage in lieu of John II. final_answer: 24

    Thus, there were a total of twenty-four groups held hostage in lieu of John II.
# wrong! This answer counts each person held hostage as a group, which doesn't make sense, since a group generally isn't a single person. The different groups that are held hostage in lieu of John II are his sons, princes and nobles, inhabitants of Paris, and citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France. Thus, there are four groups held hostage in lieu of John II.

Passage: As of the census of 2000, there were 218,590 people, 79,667 households, and 60,387 families residing in the county.  The population density was 496 people per square mile (192/km\u00b2). There were 83,146 housing units at an average density of 189 per square mile (73/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the county was 86.77% Race (United States Census), 9.27% Race (United States Census), 0.23% Race (United States Census), 1.52% Race (United States Census), 0.06% Race (United States Census), 0.69% from Race (United States Census), and 1.47% from two or more races.  1.91% of the population were Race (United States Census) or Race (United States Census) of any race. 22.5% were of German people, 13.1% Irish people, 9.8% Italian people, 9.2% English, 8.1% \"American\" and 6.0% Polish ancestry.

Question: How many more housing units are there than families?

Answer: The passage states that there were 79,667 households and 60,387 families residing in the county. 79,667 households minus 60,387 families equals 19,280. Thus, there are 19,280 more housing units than families. final_answer: 19,280

# Let's go line by line
    The passage states that there were 79,667 households and 60,387 families residing in the county.
# wrong! We are asked to calculate distance between housing units and families. Households and Housing Units are not the same thing. So we should use the number of housing units (83,146) instead of households. Let's fix it.

Let's check the next line
    79,667 households minus 60,387 families equals 19,280. Thus, there are 19,280 more housing units than families. final_answer: 19,280
# wrong! Due to the error in the previous step, this final answer is wrong. Let's fix it.

Passage: Trying to snap a two-game skid, the Bills flew to Gillette Stadium for a Week 3 divisional fight with the New England Patriots.  In the first quarter, QB J. P. Losman was immediately injured on the first offensive play of the game.  He would finish the series, but ended up on the bench for the rest of the game.  After New England took the lead with kicker Stephen Gostkowski's 24-yard field goal, rookie QB Trent Edwards played the rest of the game for Buffalo.  The Bills would get their only score of the game as RB Marshawn Lynch got an 8-yard TD run, and a Rian Lindell extra point put the Bills ahead surprisingly 7-3.  However, in the second quarter, the Patriots were able to open up their running game when Bills rookie standout Paul Posluszny was lost due to a broken arm. This left passing lanes open, and for the rest of the game, the Patriots dominated. QB Tom Brady's 8-yard TD pass to TE Benjamin Watson and a 3-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss made it 17-7 at the half.  In the third quarter, New England continued its conquest with Brady's 4-yard TD pass to WR Jabar Gaffney and RB Sammy Morris' 4-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Patriots ended the day with Brady and Moss hooking up with each other again on a 45-yard TD pass.

Question: How many points did Moss get at the end of the game?

Answer: At the end of the game, Randy Moss caught a 45-yard TD pass from Tom Brady. A touchdown is worth 6 points in American football. Thus, Moss got 6 points at the end of the game. final_answer: 6
