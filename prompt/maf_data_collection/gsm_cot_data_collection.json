    "question": "Every bedtime, Juwella reads a book. Three nights ago, she read 15 pages. Two nights ago she read twice that many pages, while last night she read 5 pages more than the previous night. She promised to read the remaining pages of the book tonight. If the book has 100 pages, how many pages will she read tonight?",
    "incorrect_solution": "Three nights ago, Juwella read 15 pages. Two nights ago, she read twice what she read three nights ago, so she read 15 * 2 = 30 pages. Last night she read 5 more pages than two nights ago, so she read 30 + 5 = 35 pages. In total, she read 15 + 30 + 35 = 80 pages during the last three nights. To finish the book, she must read 100 - 80 = 20 pages tonight.",
