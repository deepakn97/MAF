Q: Four years ago, Kody was only half as old as Mohamed. If Mohamed is currently twice 30 years
old, how old is Kody?

ASSISTANT:
A: Let's break down this problem: 1. How old is Mohamed? 2. How
old was Mohamed four years ago? 3. How old was Kody four years ago? 4. How old is Kody now?

1. Mohamed is twice 30 years old, so Mohamed is 2 * 30 = 60 years old.
2. Mohamed was 60 - 4 = 56 years old four years ago.
3. Four years ago, Kody was only half as old as Mohamed. So four years ago, Kody was 56 / 2 = 28 years old.
4. Kody is 28 + 4 = 32 years old now. The answer is 32.

Q: If Pam is currently twice as young as Rena is, and in 10 years Rena will be 5 years older than her, how old is Pam now?

ASSISTANT:
A: Let's break down this problem. 1. How much older is Rena than Pam now? 2. How old is Pam now?

1. In 10 years Rena will be 5 years older than Pam. So Rena is also 5 years older than Pam now.
2. If Pam is currently twice as young as Rena, that means that Rena is currently twice as old as Pam is. So if P stands for Pam’s age now and R stands for Rena’s age now, then we know that R = 2 * P And since Rena is 5 years older than Pam now, we know that R = P + 5. By substitution, we have P + 5 = 2 * P, which means that P = 5.

Q: Cappuccinos cost $2, iced teas cost $3, cafe lattes cost $1.5 and espressos cost $1 each. Sandy orders some drinks for herself and some friends. She orders three cappuccinos, two iced teas, two cafe lattes, and two espressos. How much change does she receive back for a twenty-dollar bill?

ASSISTANT:
A: Let's break down this problem. 1. How much did the cappuccinos cost in total? 2. How much did the iced teas cost in total? 3. How much did the cafe lattes cost in total? 4. How much did the espressos cost in total? 5. How much did the drinks cost in total? 6. How much change does she receive back for a twenty-dollar bill?

1. Cappuccinos cost $2 each, so three cappuccinos cost 2 * 3 = $6.
2. Iced teas cost $3 each, so two iced teas cost 3 * 2 = $6.
3. Cafe lattes cost $1.5 each, so two cafe lattes cost 1.5 * 2 = $3.
4. Espressos cost $1 each, so two espressos cost 1 * 2 = $2.
5. The drinks cost $6 + $6 + $3 + $2 = $17 in total. 
6. Sandy receives $20 - $17 = $3 in change. The answer is $3.
