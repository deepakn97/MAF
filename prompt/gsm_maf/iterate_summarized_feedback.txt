    chicken_cost = 2 * bacon_total_cost
# wrong! according to the context, the cost of each packet of chicken is twice the cost of 1 packet of bacon. We should use bacon_cost in place of bacon_total_cost to calculate the chicken pack cost correctly. Let's fix it.

Given the different type of feedbacks and the original code, let's rewrite the code to incorporate all of the feedback. Don't change anything unless it is mentioned in the feedback.
