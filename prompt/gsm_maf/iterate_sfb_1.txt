Missing Step Feedback:
# Let's check other parts
    chicken_packs = 6
    chicken_cost = 2 * bacon_total_cost
# wrong! bacon_cost is missing. Let's add it.
# wrong! we need the total cost of chicken to calculate remaining budget. Let's add it.

# Let's check other parts
    strawberry_packs
    strawberry_cost = 4
# wrong! we need the total cost of strawberries to calculate remaining budget. Let's add it.

# Let's check other parts
    apple_packs = 7
    apple_cost = strawberry_cost / 2
# wrong! we need the total cost of apples to calculate remaining budget. Let's add it.

Logical Reasoning Feedback:
# Let's check other parts
    chicken_packs = 6
    chicken_cost = 2 * bacon_total_cost
# wrong! according to the context, the cost of each packet of chicken is twice the cost of 1 packet of bacon. We should use bacon_cost in place of bacon_total_cost to calculate the chicken pack cost correctly. Let's fix it.

# Let's check other parts
    total_cost = bacon_cost + chicken_cost + strawberry_cost + apple_cost
    money_left = budget - total_cost
    result = money_left
    return result
# wrong! we want to calculate the total cost of buying all the items so we should use the total cost of each item instead of cost of 1 pack of each item. Let's fix it.

Given the different type of feedbacks and the original code, let's rewrite the code to incorporate all of the feedback. Don't change anything unless it is mentioned in the feedback.

Okay, here is the rewrite
