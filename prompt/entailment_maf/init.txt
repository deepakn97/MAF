Hypothesis: the earth revolving around the sun causes leo to appear in different areas in the sky at different times of year

Text:
# sent 1: leo is a kind of constellation
# sent 2: pthe earth revolving around the sun causes stars to appear in different areas in the sky at different times of year
# sent 3: a constellation contains stars

Entailment Tree:
sent 1 and sent 3: leo is a kind of constellation and a constellation contains stars -> int 1: leo is a constellation containing stars
int 1 and sent 2: leo is a constellation containing stars and the earth revolving around the sun causes stars to appear in different areas in the sky at different times of year -> hypothesis: the earth revolving around the sun causes leo to appear in different areas in the sky at different times of year

Hypothesis: mitosis produces two cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell

Text:
# sent 1: things that are identical will have the same number of parts
# sent 2: a chromosome is a part of a cell
# sent 3: mitosis produces two diploid cells from a diploid parent cell
# sent 4: a cell is a kind of thing
# sent 5: mitosis produces cells that are identical to the parent cell

Entailment Tree:
sent1 and sent2 and sent4: things that are identical will have the same number of parts and a chromosome is a part of a cell and a cell is a kind of thing -> int1: cells that are identical will have the same number of chromosomes
sent3 and sent5: mitosis produces two diploid cells from a diploid parent cell and mitosis produces cells that are identical to the parent cell -> int2: mitosis produces two diploid cells that are identical to the parent diploid cell
int1 and int2: cells that are identical will have the same number of chromosomes and mitosis produces two diploid cells that are identical to the parent diploid cell -> hypothesis: mitosis produces two cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell

Hypothesis: chemical weathering can cause iron in rock to oxidize and change the color of the rock to yellow, red, or orange

Text:
# sent 1: the color of an environment means the color of the things that environment contains
# sent 2: color is a property of an object / a material
# sent 3: if an object undergoes chemical change then that object will have new chemical properties
# sent 4: igneous rock is a kind of rock
# sent 5: a change in soil chemistry is a kind of chemical weathering
# sent 6: the rock cycle is a cyclical process, with stages of formation, weathering, erosion
# sent 7: phase means state
# sent 8: the color of an object can be discovered by looking at that object
# sent 9: oxidation of iron will change the iron to yellow, red, or orange color
# sent 10: to change means to cause a change
# sent 11: a cause of something is a reason for that something
# sent 12: if something is caused by something else , then that something can be explained by that something else
# sent 13: as the state of matter changes , the color of the object will stay the same
# sent 14: the chemistry of something is similar to what that something is made of
# sent 15: weathering occurs at the the surface of the earth
# sent 16: rocks sometimes contain iron
# sent 17: to change means to have an effect
# sent 18: alteration means change
# sent 19: temperature changing can cause phase changes
# sent 20: pink is a combination of red and white
# sent 21: chemical weathering causes iron in rock to oxidize
# sent 22: iron element in soil causes soil to be red
# sent 23: chemical change is a kind of chemical reaction
# sent 24: sedimentary rocks are often light brown in color
# sent 25: chemical reactions cause new substances / different substances to form

Entailment Tree:
sent16 and sent21 and sent9: rocks sometimes contain iron and chemical weathering causes iron in rock to oxidize and oxidation of iron will change the iron to yellow, red, or orange color -> hypothesis: chemical weathering can cause iron in rock to oxidize and change the color of the rock to yellow, red, or orange

Hypothesis: drought can cause plants to dry out and cause wildfires

Text:
# sent 1: a drought is a kind of slow environmental change
# sent 2: drought is when available water decreases in an environment
# sent 3: rainfall is the amount of rain an area receives
# sent 4: a plants / living things require water for survival / to grow
# sent 5: water is a kind of natural resource
# sent 6: decreasing something negative has a positive impact on a thing
# sent 7: if water vapor is limited to reach a location , then that location will be dry
# sent 8: rain is a kind of water
# sent 9: rainfall means precipitation
# sent 10: precipitation is a kind of natural occurrence / cause
# sent 11: plants require water to survive
# sent 12: el nio causes drought in the western united states
# sent 13: humans changing an environment sometimes causes that environment to be destroyed
# sent 14: wildfire means forest fire
# sent 15: if a plant / crop requires less water then that plant / crop will survive in a drought
# sent 16: if something causes a process then that something is required for that process
# sent 17: drought may cause wildfires
# sent 18: humans changing ecosystems / environments usually has a negative impact on an ecosystem / organisms living in an ecosystem
# sent 19: drying up means losing all water
# sent 20: to cause means to have an effect
# sent 21: moisture means liquid / liquid water
# sent 22: to cause means to result in
# sent 23: plants drying out means plants do not have enough water to survive
# sent 24: rainfall means the amount of precipitation
# sent 25: as the amount of rainfall increases in an area , the amount of available water in that area will increase

Entailment Tree:
sent11 and sent2: plants require water to survive and drought is when available water decreases in an environment -> int1: drought will decrease the water plants need to survive
int1 and sent23: drought will decrease the water plants need to survive and plants drying out means plants do not have enough water to survive -> int2: drought can cause plants to dry out
int2 and sent17: drought can cause plants to dry out and drought may cause wildfires -> hypothesis: drought can cause plants to dry out and cause wildfires
