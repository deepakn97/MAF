Hypothesis: the mountain used to be covered by oceans in the past

Text:
sent1: fossils of sharks are found on top of a mountain
sent2: sharks live in oceans
sent3: a shark is a kind of fish
sent4: if fossils of an aquatic animal or plant are found in a place then that place used to be covered by water in the past
sent5: the top of a mountain is a kind of place
sent6: an ocean is a kind of body of water
sent7: a fish is a kind of aquatic animal

sent3 and sent7: a shark is a kind of fish and a fish is a kind of aquatic animal -> int1: a shark is a kind of aquatic animal
sent1 and int1: fossils of sharks are found on top of a mountain and a shark is a kind of aquatic animal -> int2: fossils of an aquatic animal are found on top of a mountain
sent2 and sent6: sharks live in oceans and an ocean is a kind of body of water -> int3: sharks live in a kind of body of water
int2 and int3 and sent4: fossils of an aquatic animal are found on top of a mountain and sharks live in a kind of body of water and if fossils of an aquatic animal or plant are found in a place then that place used to be covered by water in the past -> int4: the top of a mountain used to be covered by water in the past
int4 and sent5: the top of a mountain used to be covered by water in the past and the top of a mountain is a kind of place -> hypothesis: the mountain used to be covered by oceans in the past

# There may be redundant information in the above entailment tree that is not relevant to entailing the hypothesis. To find the error, look through the entailment tree line by line and check that everything looks good. Ignore all other types of errors.

# Let's go line by line

# Looks good.

# Wrong! The premise int3 that "sharks live in a kind of body of water" is not needed to prove the hypothesis int4 that "the top of a mountain used to be covered by water in the past". So, we can remove the premise int3 from this line and rewrite it as the following valid entailment: 
int2 and sent4: fossils of an aquatic animal are found on top of a mountain and if fossils of an aquatic animal or plant are found in a place then that place used to be covered by water in the past -> int4: the top of a mountain used to be covered by water in the past

Hypothesis: the earth rotating on its axis causes stars to move relative to the horizon during the night

Text:
sent1: earth is a kind of celestial object,
sent2: stars appear to move relative to the horizon during the night,
sent3: a star is a kind of celestial object / celestial body,
sent4: the earth rotating on its axis causes stars to appear to move across the sky at night,
sent5: apparent motion is when an object appears to move relative to another object 's position

Entailment Tree:
sent1 and sent4: earth is a kind of celestial object and the earth rotating on its axis causes stars to appear to move across the sky at night -> int1: the earth rotating on its axis is a celestial event
int1 and sent3: the earth rotating on its axis is a celestial event and a star is a kind of celestial object -> int2: the earth rotating on its axis can cause stars to move
int2 and sent2: the earth rotating on its axis can cause stars to move and stars appear to move relative to the horizon during the night -> hypothesis: the earth rotating on its axis causes stars to move relative to the horizon during the night

# There may be redundant information in the above entailment tree that is not relevant to entailing the hypothesis. To find the error, look through the entailment tree line by line and check that everything looks good. Ignore all other types of errors.

# Let's go line by line
sent1 and sent4: earth is a kind of celestial object and the earth rotating on its axis causes stars to appear to move across the sky at night -> int1: the earth rotating on its axis is a celestial event
# Wrong! The conclusion int1 that "the earth rotating on its axis is a celestial event" is not needed to prove the hypothesis that "the earth rotating on its axis causes stars to move relative to the horizon during the night". So, we can remove this line from the entailment tree entirely.

# Let's check the next line
int1 and sent3: the earth rotating on its axis is a celestial event and a star is a kind of celestial object -> int2: the earth rotating on its axis can cause stars to move
# Wrong! The premise int1 that "the earth rotating on its axis is a celestial event" and the premise int2 that "a star is a kind of celestial object" are both irrelevant to the conclusion int2 that "the earth rotating on its axis can cause stars to move". Because all premises of this step are invalid, we can remove this line from the entailment tree entirely.

# Let's check the next line
int2 and sent2: the earth rotating on its axis can cause stars to move and stars appear to move relative to the horizon during the night -> hypothesis: the earth rotating on its axis causes stars to move relative to the horizon during the night

Hypothesis: safety goggles can be used to protect students' eyes from acids and bases

Text:
sent1: safety goggles are used for protecting the eyes during experiments
sent2: students have to work with acids and bases for experiments
sent3: corrosive substance can cause harm to the eyes
sent4: acids are corrosive
sent5: a base is corrosive

Entailment Tree:
sent3 and sent4 and sent5: corrosive substance can cause harm to the eyes and acids are corrosive and a base is corrosive -> int1: acids and bases can cause harm to the eyes
int1 and sent2: acids and bases can cause harm to the eyes and students have to work with acids and bases for experiments -> int2: acids and bases may cause harm to students' eyes during experiments
int2 and sent1: acids and bases may cause harm to students' eyes during experiments and safety goggles are used for protecting the eyes during experiments -> hypothesis: safety goggles can be used to protect students' eyes from acids and bases

# There is no error in the entailment tree. It is correct!

Hypothesis: the sun will be the star that appears the brightest to the earth

Text:
sent1: the sun is the star that is closest to earth
sent2: the four planets farthest from the sun are made of gas
sent3: far means great in distance
sent4: furthest / farthest means greatest / most / highest in distance
sent5: to be in the sun means to be in the sunlight
sent6: appear is similar to apparent
sent7: brightness means amount of light
sent8: nearby is similar to near
sent9: as distance from an object decreases , that object will appear larger
sent10: as distance to an object increases , that object will appear smaller
sent11: as a source of light becomes closer , the light will appear brighter
sent12: apparent magnitude is a measure of the brightness of a celestial object / celestial body as observed on earth,
sent13: a source of something produces that something
sent14: near means close
sent15: the sun is located near the edge of the milky way galaxy
sent16: a star produces light

Entailment Tree:
sent1: the sun is the star that is closest to earth -> int1: the sun is the nearest star to earth
int1 and sent6: the sun is the nearest star to earth and appear is similar to apparent -> int2: the sun will appear the most apparent to earth
int2 and sent7: the sun will appear the most apparent to earth and brightness means amount of light -> hypothesis: the sun will appear the brightest to earth

# There may be redundant information in the above entailment tree that is not relevant to entailing the hypothesis. To find the error, look through the entailment tree line by line and check that everything looks good. Ignore all other types of errors.

# Let's go through line by line
sent1: the sun is the star that is closest to earth -> int1: the sun is the nearest star to earth
# Looks good.

# Let's check the next line
int1 and sent6: the sun is the nearest star to earth and appear is similar to apparent -> int2: the sun will appear the most apparent to earth
# The premise sent6 that "appear is similar to apparent" is irrelevant to the conclusion int2 that "the sun will appear the most apparent to earth". Let's remove that premise from this step.

# Let's check the next line
int2 and sent7: the sun will appear the most apparent to earth and brightness means amount of light -> hypothesis: the sun will appear the brightest to earth
# Both premises that "the sun will appear the most apparent to earth" and "brightness means amount of light" are irrelevant to the conclusion that "the sun will appear the brightest to earth". Let's remove both premises from this line. Because this line entails the hypothesis and we know the hypothesis must be in the correct entailment tree, we do not remove this line entirely.
