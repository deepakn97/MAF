Hypothesis: Eruptions can cause plants to die

Text:
# sent 1: eruptions emit lava
# sent 2: plants have green leaves
# sent 3: eruptions produce ash clouds
# sent 4: producers will die without sunlight
# sent 5: ash blocks sunlight

Entailment Tree:
sent 3 and sent 5: eruptions produce ash clouds and ash blocks sunlight -> int 1: eruptions block sunlight
int 1 and sent 4: eruptions block sunlight and producers will die without sunlight -> int 2: eruptions can kill plants by blocking sunlight
sent 4 and int 2: producers will die without sunlight and eruptions can kill plants by blocking sunlight -> H: Eruptions can cause plants to die

# Check the above entailment tree line by line for any missing steps and suggest fixes. Ignore all other types of errors.

# Let us go through the entailment tree line by line.
    sent 3 and sent 5: eruptions produce ash clouds and ash blocks sunlight -> int 1: eruptions block sunlight
# Looks good

# Let's check other parts
    int 1 and sent 4: eruptions block sunlight and producers will die without sunlight -> int 2: eruptions can kill plants by blocking sunlight
# Looks good

# Let's check other parts
    sent 4 and int 1: producers will die without sunlight and eruptions block sunlight -> H: Eruptions can cause plants to die
# Looks good

# There are not missing step errors! Here is the rewrite (for the sake of completeness):

Hypothesis: An astronaut requires the oxygen in a spacesuit backpack to breathe

Text:
# sent 1: spacesuit backpacks contain oxygen
# sent 2: an animal requires oxygen to breathe
# sent 3: a vacuum does not contain oxygen
# sent 4: an astronaut is a kind of human
# sent 5: a human is a kind of animal
# sent 6: space is a vacuum


Entailment Tree:
sent 4 and sent 2: an astronaut is a kind of human and an animal requires oxygen to breathe -> int 1: an astronaut requires oxygen to breathe
sent 1 and int 1: spacesuit backpacks contain oxygen and an astronaut requires oxygen to breathe -> H: An astronaut requires the oxygen in a spacesuit backpack to breathe

# Check the above entailment tree line by line for any missing steps and suggest fixes. Ignore all other types of errors.

# Let us go through the entailment tree line by line.
    sent 4 and sent 2: an astronaut is a kind of human and an animal requires oxygen to breathe -> int 1: an astronaut requires oxygen to breathe
# wrong! this step is missing the connection that humans are a kind of animal. Let's add that.

# Let's check other parts
    sent 1 and int 1: spacesuit backpacks contain oxygen and an astronaut requires oxygen to breathe -> H: An astronaut requires the oxygen in a spacesuit backpack to breathe
# wrong! missing step that there is no oxygen in space. Let's add that

# Okay, here is the rewrite:

Entailment Tree:
sent 4 and sent 5: an astronaut is a kind of human and a human is a kind of animal -> int 1: an astronaut is a kind of animal
sent 2 and int 1: an animal requires oxygen to breathe and an astronaut is a kind of animal -> int 2: an astronaut requires oxygen to breathe
sent 3 and sent 6: a vacuum does not contain oxygen and space is a vacuum -> int 3: there is no oxygen in space
sent 1 and int 2 and int 3: spacesuit backpacks contain oxygen and there is no oxygen in space and an astronaut requires oxygen to breathe -> H: an astronaut requires the oxygen in spacesuit backpack to breathe

Hypothesis: evaporating and condensing can both be caused by changes in heat energy

Text: 
# sent 1: temperature is a measure of heat energy

# sent 3: evaporating is a kind of phase change

sent 2 and sent 4: temperature changes can cause phase changes and condensing is a kind of phase change -> int 3: temperature changes can cause condensing
sent 1 and int 2 and int 3: temperature is a mesaure of heat energy and temperature changes can cause evaporating and temperature changes can cause condensing -> int 4: changes in heat energy can cause evaporating and condensing

# wrong! The entailment tree only arrives at part of the hypothesis. The sentence 'Evaporating can be caused by changes in heat energy' must be an intermediate.

# Let's check other parts
    sent 4 and int 1: condensing is a kind of phase change and changes in heat energy can cause phase changes -> H: Condensing can be caused by changes in heat energy
# wrong! The entailment tree only arrives at part of the hypothesis. The sentence 'Condensing can be caused by changes in heat energy' must be an intermediate. We can combine this with 'Evaporating can be caused by changes in heat energy' to arrive at the conclusion.
