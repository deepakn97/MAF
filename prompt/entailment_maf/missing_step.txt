Hypothesis: it is winter in florida

Text: 
sent1: summer is when a hemisphere is tilted towards the sun
sent2: the south pole is tilted toward the sun
sent3: florida is a state located in the united states of america
sent4: united states is located in the northern hemisphere
sent5: the south pole is located in the southern hemisphere
sent6: the winter in the northern hemisphere is during the summer in the southern hemisphere

Entailment Tree:
sent3 and sent4: florida is a state located in the united states of america and united states is located in the northern hemisphere -> int1: florida is located in the northern hemisphere
int1 and sent6: florida is located in the northern hemisphere and the winter in the northern hemisphere is during the summer in the southern hemisphere -> hypothesis: it is winter in florida

# There is an error in the entailment tree above due to lack of understanding of the problem. What is the error? To find the error, go through the entailment tree line by line and check that everything looks good.

# Let's go line by line
sent3 and sent4: florida is a state located in the united states of america and united states is located in the northern hemisphere -> int1: florida is located in the northern hemisphere
# Looks good

# Let's check the next line
int1 and sent6: florida is located in the northern hemisphere and the winter in the northern hemisphere is during the summer in the southern hemisphere -> hypothesis: it is winter in florida
# Wrong! This entailment can only conclude that it is winter in florida when it is summer in the southern hemisphere. However, it is missing the step that establishes that it is summer in the southern hemisphere.

# Given the feedback and the original entailment tree, let's rewrite the entailment tree to incorporate all of the feedback. Don't change anything unless it is mentioned in the feedback.

sent3 and sent4: florida is a state located in the united states of america and united states is located in the northern hemisphere -> int1: florida is located in the northern hemisphere
int1 and sent6: florida is located in the northern hemisphere and the winter in the northern hemisphere is during the summer in the southern hemisphere -> int2: it is winter in florida when it is summer in the southern hemisphere
sent2 and sent5: the south pole is tilted toward the sun and the south pole is located in the southern hemisphere -> int3: the southern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun
int3 and sent1: the southern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun and summer is when a hemisphere is tilted towards the sun -> int4: it is summer in the southern hemisphere

Hypothesis: a complete revolution of earth around the sun takes an earth year

Text: 
sent1: earth is a kind of planet
sent2: the sun is a kind of star
sent3: the earth revolves around the sun
sent4: a complete revolution / orbit of a planet around its star takes 1 / one planetary year

Entailment Tree:
sent1 and sent2: earth is a kind of planet and the sun is a kind of star -> int1: earth revolves around the sun
int1 and sent4: earth revolves around the sun and a complete revolution / orbit of a planet around its star takes 1 / one planetary year -> hypothesis: a complete revolution of earth around the sun takes an earth year

# There is an error in the entailment tree above due to lack of understanding of the problem. What is the error? To find the error, go through the entailment tree line by line and check that everything looks good.

# Let's go line by line
sent1 and sent2: earth is a kind of planet and the sun is a kind of star -> int1: earth revolves around the sun
# Wrong! This line is missing steps because it does not follow directly from sent1 and sent2 that the earth revolves around the sun.

# Let's check the next line
int1 and sent4: earth revolves around the sun and a complete revolution / orbit of a planet around its star takes 1 / one planetary year -> hypothesis: a complete revolution of earth around the sun takes an earth year
# Wrong! This line misses a premise that establishes that the sun is a star. Otherwise, we cannot conclude that it takes one earth year to revolve around the sun based on sent4.
