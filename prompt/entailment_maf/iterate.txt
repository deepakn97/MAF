Hypothesis: Eruptions can cause plants to die

Text:
# sent 1: eruptions emit lava
# sent 2: plants have green leaves
# sent 3: eruptions produce ash clouds
# sent 4: producers will die without sunlight
# sent 5: ash blocks sunlight
# sent 6: ash is a kind of fine rock, mineral, and glass particles
# sent 7: lava is hot

Entailment Tree:
sent 3 and sent 5: eruptions produce ash clouds and ash blocks sunlight -> int 1: eruptions block sunlight
sent 1 and sent 7: eruptions emit lava and lava is hot -> int 2: eruptions are hot
int 1 and sent 4: eruptions block sunlight and producers will die without sunlight -> int 2: eruptions can kill plants by blocking sunlight
sent 4 and int 2: producers will die without sunlight and eruptions can kill plants by blocking sunlight -> H: Eruptions can cause plants to die
