Hypothesis: a complete revolution of earth around the sun takes an earth year

Text: 
sent1: earth is a kind of planet
sent2: the sun is a kind of star
sent3: the earth revolves around the sun
sent4: a complete revolution / orbit of a planet around its star takes 1 / one planetary year

Entailment Tree:
sent1 and sent2: earth is a kind of planet and the sun is a kind of star -> int1: earth revolves around the sun
int1 and sent4: earth revolves around the sun and a complete revolution / orbit of a planet around its star takes 1 / one planetary year -> hypothesis: a complete revolution of earth around the sun takes an earth year

# Missing Step Feedback
# Let's go line by line
sent1 and sent2: earth is a kind of planet and the sun is a kind of star -> int1: earth revolves around the sun
# Wrong! We cannot conclude that the earth revolves around the sun based on just sent1 and sent2. From the initial text, we can see that sent3 establishes that the earth revolves around the sun. We can add sent3 to this line to turn it into a valid entailment.

# Let's check the next line
int1 and sent4: earth revolves around the sun and a complete revolution / orbit of a planet around its star takes 1 / one planetary year -> hypothesis: a complete revolution of earth around the sun takes an earth year
# Wrong! This line misses premises that establish that earth is a planet and that the sun is a star. Otherwise, we cannot conclude that "a complete revolution of earth around the sun takes an earth year" since we do not know that the earth is a planet revolving around its star or that the sun is earth's star From the initial text, we can see that sent1 establishes that earth is a kind of planet and sent2 establishes that the sun is a star. We can add sent1 and sent2 to this entailment tree to turn it into a valid entailment.

# Repetition Feedback:
# Let's go line by line
sent1 and sent2: earth is a kind of planet and the sun is a kind of star -> int1: earth revolves around the sun
# Wrong! The intermediate conclusion int1 that "earth revolves around the sun" is exactly the same as the initial sentence sent3 that "earth revolves around the sun". We can remove this line from the entailment tree and use sent3 in place of int1.

# Redundancy Feedback:
# Let's go line by line
sent1 and sent2: earth is a kind of planet and the sun is a kind of star -> int1: earth revolves around the sun
# Wrong! The premise sent1 that "earth is a kind of planet" and the premise sent2 that "the sun is a kind of star" are irrelevant to the intermediate conclusion int1 that "earth revolves around the sun". Because all premises are invalid, we can remove this line from the entailment tree.

# Given the feedback and the original answer, let's rewrite the answer to incorporate all the feedback. Let's think step by step. Don't change anything unless it is mentioned in the feedback.

# First, let's remove the following line:
sent1 and sent2: earth is a kind of planet and the sun is a kind of star -> int1: earth revolves around the sun
# This is the intermediate conclusion int1 is exactly the same as the initial sentence sent3. We can remove this line from the entailment tree and use sent3 in place of int1.

# Next, let's add the following line:
sent1 and sent2 and sent3: earth is a kind of planet and the sun is a kind of star and the earth revolves around the sun -> int1: earth revolving the sun is an example of a planet revolving around its star
# From the missing step feedback, we know that we need to establish that earth is a planet revolving around its star and that the sun is earth's star. We can use sent1 and sent2 to establish that earth is a planet revolving around its star and we can use sent3 to establish that the sun is earth's star. We can combine sent1, sent2, and sent3 to form the premise int1 that "earth revolving the sun is an example of a planet revolving around its star". We do not add all three sentences to the original line with int1 because then the line would have four premises which is too many for a single step.

# Finally, let's change the last line into the following:
int1 and sent4: earth revolving the sun is an example of a planet revolving around its star and a complete revolution / orbit of a planet around its star takes 1 / one planetary year -> hypothesis: a complete revolution of earth around the sun takes an earth year
# From the missing step feedback, we know that we need to establish that earth revolving the sun is an example of a planet revolving around its star in order to use sent4 to conclude that "a complete revolution of earth around the sun takes an earth year". This is stated in the new int1 in the rewrite so we can combine int1 and sent4 which states that "a complete revolution of earth around the sun takes an earth year" to conclude the hypothesis that "a complete revolution of earth around the sun takes an earth year".

# Okay, here is the rewrite:
sent1 and sent2 and sent3: earth is a kind of planet and the sun is a kind of star and the earth revolves around the sun -> int1: earth revolving the sun is an example of a planet revolving around its star
int1 and sent4: earth revolving the sun is an example of a planet revolving around its star and a complete revolution / orbit of a planet around its star takes 1 / one planetary year -> hypothesis: a complete revolution of earth around the sun takes an earth year

Hypothesis: evaporating and condensing can both be caused by changes in heat energy

Text: 
# sent 1: temperature is a measure of heat energy
# sent 2: temperature changes can cause phase changes
# sent 3: evaporating is a kind of phase change
# sent 4: condensing is a kind of phase change

Entailment Tree:
sent 1 and sent 2: temperature is a measure of heat energy and temperature changes can cause phase changes -> int 1: changes in heat energy can cause phase changes
sent 3 and sent 4: evaporating is a kind of phase change and condensing is a kind of phase change -> int 2: evaporating and condensing are both kinds of phase changes
int 1 and int 2: changes in heat energy can cause phase changes and evaporating and condensing are both kinds of phase changes -> hypothesis: evaporating and condensing can both be caused by changes in heat energy
