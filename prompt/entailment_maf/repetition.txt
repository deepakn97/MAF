Hypothesis: a complete revolution of earth around the sun takes an earth year

Text: 
sent1: earth is a kind of planet
sent2: the sun is a kind of star
sent3: the earth revolves around the sun
sent4: a complete revolution / orbit of a planet around its star takes 1 / one planetary year

Entailment Tree:
sent1 and sent2: earth is a kind of planet and the sun is a kind of star -> int1: the earth revolves around the sun
int1 and sent4: the earth revolves around the sun and a complete revolution / orbit of a planet around its star takes 1 / one planetary year -> hypothesis: a complete revolution of earth around the sun takes an earth year

# There may be repeated information in the entailment tree above. What is the error? To find the error, go through the entailment tree line by line and check that everything looks good. Ignore all other types of errors.

# Let's go line by line
sent1 and sent2: earth is a kind of planet and the sun is a kind of star -> int1: the earth revolves around the sun
# Wrong! The intermediate conclusion int1 that "the earth revolves around the sun" is exactly the same as the initial sentence sent3 that "the earth revolves around the sun". We can remove this line from the entailment tree and use sent3 in place of int1.

# Let's check the next line
int1 and sent4: earth revolves around the sun and a complete revolution / orbit of a planet around its star takes 1 / one planetary year -> hypothesis: a complete revolution of earth around the sun takes an earth year
# Looks good.

Hypothesis: the sun will be the star that appears the brightest to the earth

Text:
sent1: the sun is the star that is closest to earth
sent2: the four planets farthest from the sun are made of gas
sent3: far means great in distance
sent4: furthest / farthest means greatest / most / highest in distance
sent5: to be in the sun means to be in the sunlight
sent6: appear is similar to apparent
sent7: brightness means amount of light
sent8: nearby is similar to near
sent9: as distance from an object decreases , that object will appear larger
sent10: as distance to an object increases , that object will appear smaller
sent11: as a source of light becomes closer , the light will appear brighter
sent12: apparent magnitude is a measure of the brightness of a celestial object / celestial body as observed on earth,
sent13: a source of something produces that something
sent14: near means close
sent15: the sun is located near the edge of the milky way galaxy
sent16: a star produces light

Entailment Tree:
sent1: the sun is the star that is closest to earth -> int1: the sun is the nearest star to earth
int1 and sent6: the sun is the nearest star to earth and appear is similar to apparent -> int2: the sun will appear the most apparent to earth
int2 and sent7: the sun will appear the most apparent to earth and brightness means amount of light -> hypothesis: the sun will appear the brightest to earth

# There may be repeated information in the entailment tree above. What is the error? To find the error, go through the entailment tree line by line and check that everything looks good. Ignore all other types of errors.

# Let's go through line by line
sent1: the sun is the star that is closest to earth -> int1: the sun is the nearest star to earth
# Wrong! This entailment only has a single premise going to the conclusion which is never valid. The intermediate conclusion int1 that "the sun is the nearest star to earth" repeats initial sentence sent1 that "the sun is the star that is closest to earth" without contributing any new information. We can remove this line from the entailment tree and use sent1 in place of int1.

# Let's check the next line
int1 and sent6: the sun is the nearest star to earth and appear is similar to apparent -> int2: the sun will appear the most apparent to earth
# Looks good.

# Let's check the next line
int2 and sent7: the sun will appear the most apparent to earth and brightness means amount of light -> hypothesis: the sun will appear the brightest to earth
# Looks good.

Hypothesis: safety goggles can be used to protect students' eyes from acids and bases

Text:
sent1: safety goggles are used for protecting the eyes during experiments
sent2: students have to work with acids and bases for experiments
sent3: corrosive substance can cause harm to the eyes
sent4: acids are corrosive
sent5: a base is corrosive

Entailment Tree:
sent3 and sent4 and sent5: corrosive substance can cause harm to the eyes and acids are corrosive and a base is corrosive -> int1: acids and bases can cause harm to the eyes
int1 and sent2: acids and bases can cause harm to the eyes and students have to work with acids and bases for experiments -> int2: acids and bases may cause harm to students' eyes during experiments
int2 and sent1: acids and bases may cause harm to students' eyes during experiments and safety goggles are used for protecting the eyes during experiments -> hypothesis: safety goggles can be used to protect students' eyes from acids and bases

# There may be repeated information in the entailment tree above. What is the error? To find the error, go through the entailment tree line by line and check that everything looks good. Only check for cases where information is repeated exactly. Ignore all other types of errors.

# Let's go through line by line
sent3 and sent4 and sent5: corrosive substance can cause harm to the eyes and acids are corrosive and a base is corrosive -> int1: acids and bases can cause harm to the eyes
# Looks good.

# Let's check the next line
int1 and sent2: acids and bases can cause harm to the eyes and students have to work with acids and bases for experiments -> int2: acids and bases may cause harm to students' eyes during experiments
# Looks good.
