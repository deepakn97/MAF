Hypothesis: a complete revolution of earth around the sun takes an earth year

Text: 
sent1: earth is a kind of planet
sent2: the sun is a kind of star
sent3: the earth revolves around the sun
sent4: a complete revolution / orbit of a planet around its star takes 1 / one planetary year

Entailment Tree:
sent1 and sent2: earth is a kind of planet and the sun is a kind of star -> int1: earth revolves around the sun
int1 and sent4: earth revolves around the sun and a complete revolution / orbit of a planet around its star takes 1 / one planetary year -> hypothesis: a complete revolution of earth around the sun takes an earth year

# There is an error in the entailment tree above due to lack of understanding of the problem. What is the error? To find the error, go through the entailment tree line by line and check that everything looks good.

# Let's go line by line
sent1 and sent2: earth is a kind of planet and the sun is a kind of star -> int1: earth revolves around the sun
# Wrong! This line directly restates the initial sentence sent3 in int1. We can remove this line from the entailment tree and use sent3 in place of int1.

# Let's check the next line
int1 and sent4: earth revolves around the sun and a complete revolution / orbit of a planet around its star takes 1 / one planetary year -> hypothesis: a complete revolution of earth around the sun takes an earth year
# Wrong! Looks good

Hypothesis: the sun will be the star that appears the brightest to the earth

Text:
sent1: the sun is the star that is closest to earth
sent2: the four planets farthest from the sun are made of gas
sent3: far means great in distance
sent4: furthest / farthest means greatest / most / highest in distance
sent5: to be in the sun means to be in the sunlight
sent6: appear is similar to apparent
sent7: brightness means amount of light
sent8: nearby is similar to near
sent9: as distance from an object decreases , that object will appear larger
sent10: as distance to an object increases , that object will appear smaller
sent11: as a source of light becomes closer , the light will appear brighter
sent12: apparent magnitude is a measure of the brightness of a celestial object / celestial body as observed on earth,
sent13: a source of something produces that something
sent14: near means close
sent15: the sun is located near the edge of the milky way galaxy
sent16: a star produces light

Entailment Tree:
sent1: the sun is the star that is closest to earth -> int1: the sun is the nearest star to earth
int1 and sent6: the sun is the nearest star to earth and appear is similar to apparent -> int2: the sun will appear the most apparent to earth
int2 and sent7: the sun will appear the most apparent to earth and brightness means amount of light -> int3: the sun will appear the brightest to earth
int3: the sun will appear the brightest to earth -> hypothesis: the sun will be the star that appears the brightest to the earth

# There is an error in the entailment tree above due to lack of understanding of the problem. What is the error? To find the error, go through the entailment tree line by line and check that everything looks good.


# Let's go through line by line
sent1: the sun is the star that is closest to earth -> int1: the sun is the nearest star to earth
# Wrong! This line directly restates one of the initial sentences. We can remove this line from the entailment tree.

# Let's check the next line
int1 and sent6: the sun is the nearest star to earth and appear is similar to apparent -> int2: the sun will appear the most apparent to earth
# This line is correct. We can keep it.

# Let's check the next line
int2 and sent7: the sun will appear the most apparent to earth and brightness means amount of light -> int3: the sun will appear the brightest to earth
# This line is correct. We can keep it.

# Let's check the next line
int3: the sun will appear the brightest to earth -> hypothesis: the sun will be the star that appears the brightest to the earth
# Wrong! This line restates the hypothesis. We can remove this line from the entailment tree and replace int3 wih the hypothesis.
