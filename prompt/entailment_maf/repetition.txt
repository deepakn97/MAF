Hypothesis: Eruptions can cause plants to die

Text:
# sent 1: eruptions emit lava
# sent 2: plants have green leaves
# sent 3: eruptions produce ash clouds
# sent 4: producers will die without sunlight
# sent 5: ash blocks sunlight

Entailment Tree:
sent 3 and sent 5: eruptions produce ash clouds and ash blocks sunlight -> int 1: eruptions block sunlight
int 1 and sent 4: eruptions block sunlight and producers will die without sunlight -> int 2: eruptions can kill plants by blocking sunlight
sent 4 and int 2: producers will die without sunlight and eruptions can kill plants by blocking sunlight -> H: Eruptions can cause plants to die

# Check the above entailment tree line by line for any repetition errors and suggest fixes. Ignore all other types of errors.

# Let us go through the entailment tree line by line.
    sent 3 and sent 5: eruptions produce ash clouds and ash blocks sunlight -> int 1: eruptions block sunlight
# looks good

# Let's check other parts
    int 1 and sent 4: eruptions block sunlight and producers will die without sunlight -> int 2: eruptions can kill plants by blocking sunlight
# looks good

# Let's check other parts
    sent 4 and int 2: producers will die without sunlight and eruptions can kill plants by blocking sunlight -> H: Eruptions can cause plants to die
# wrong! int 2 "eruptions can kill plants by blocking sunlight" is just paraphrased in the hypothesis "eruptions can cause plants to die". Let's remove it.

# Okay, here is the rewrite:

Entailment Tree:
sent 3 and sent 5: eruptions produce ash clouds and ash blocks sunlight -> int 1: eruptions block sunlight
int 1 and sent 4: eruptions block sunlight and producers will die without sunlight -> H: Eruptions can cause plants to die

Hypothesis: An astronaut requires the oxygen in a spacesuit backpack to breathe

Text:
# sent 1: spacesuit backpacks contain oxygen
# sent 2: an animal requires oxygen to breathe
# sent 3: a vacuum does not contain oxygen
# sent 4: an astronaut is a kind of human
# sent 5: a human is a kind of animal
# sent 6: space is a vacuum

Entailment Tree:
sent 4 and sent 2: an astronaut is a kind of human and an animal requires oxygen to breathe -> int 1: an astronaut requires oxygen to breathe
sent 1 and int 1: spacesuit backpacks contain oxygen and an astronaut requires oxygen to breathe -> H: An astronaut requires the oxygen in a spacesuit backpack to breathe

# There are no repetition errors in this entailment tree! Here is the rewrite (for the sake of completeness):

Entailment Tree:
sent 4 and sent 2: an astronaut is a kind of human and an animal requires oxygen to breathe -> int 1: an astronaut requires oxygen to breathe
sent 1 and int 1: spacesuit backpacks contain oxygen and an astronaut requires oxygen to breathe -> H: An astronaut requires the oxygen in a spacesuit backpack to breathe

Hypothesis: evaporating and condensing can both be caused by changes in heat energy

Text: 
# sent 1: temperature is a measure of heat energy
