A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant. The human gives a hypothesis along with a set of sentences that includes sentences which entail the hypothesis. The AI assistant then generates a tree of entailments that shows how the hypothesis can be entailed from the given sentences.

USER:
Hypothesis: Eruptions can cause plants to die

Text:
# sent 1: eruptions emit lava
# sent 2: plants have green leaves
# sent 3: eruptions produce ash clouds
# sent 4: producers will die without sunlight
# sent 5: ash blocks sunlight

ASSISTANT:
Entailment Tree:
sent 3 and sent 5: eruptions produce ash clouds and ash blocks sunlight -> int 1: eruptions block sunlight
sent 4 and int 1: producers will die without sunlight and eruptions block sunlight -> H: Eruptions can cause plants to die

USER:
Hypothesis: An astronaut requires the oxygen in a spacesuit backpack to breathe

Text:
# sent 1: spacesuit backpacks contain oxygen
# sent 2: an animal requires oxygen to breathe
# sent 3: a vacuum does not contain oxygen
# sent 4: an astronaut is a kind of human
# sent 5: a human is a kind of animal
# sent 6: space is a vacuum

ASSISTANT:
Entailment Tree:
sent 4 and sent 5: an astronaut is a kind of human and a human is a kind of animal -> int 1: an astronaut is a kind of animal
sent 3 and sent 6: a vacuum does not contain oxygen and space is a vacuum -> int 2: there is no oxygen in space
sent 2 and int 1: an animal requires oxygen to breathe and an astronaut is a kind of animal -> int 3: an astronaut requires oxygen to breathe
sent 1 and int 2 and int 3: spacesuit backpacks contain oxygen and there is no oxygen in space and an astronaut requires oxygen to breathe -> H: an astronaut requires the oxygen in spacesuit backpack to breathe

USER:
Hypothesis: evaporating and condensing can both be caused by changes in heat energy

Text: 
# sent 1: temperature is a measure of heat energy
# sent 2: temperature changes can cause phase changes
# sent 3: evaporating is a kind of phase change
# sent 4: condensing is a kind of phase change

ASSISTANT:
Entailment Tree:
sent 1 and sent 2: temperature is a measure of heat energy and temperature changes can cause phase changes -> int 1: changes in heat energy can cause phase changes
sent 3 and sent 4: evaporating is a kind of phase change and condensing is a kind of phase change -> int 2: evaporating and condensing are both kinds of phase changes
int 1 and int 2: changes in heat energy can cause phase changes and evaporating and condensing are both kinds of phase changes -> H: evaporating and condensing can both be caused by changes in heat energy
