# Self-Refine: Iterative Refinement with Self-Feedback

_With Self-Refine, LLMs can generate feedback on their work, use it to improve the output, and repeat this process._

## Setup

* We use [prompt-lib](https://github.com/reasoning-machines/prompt-lib) for querying LLMs. You can install `prompt-lib` by running the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/reasoning-machines/prompt-lib
pip install prompt-lib/
```

Depending on your default settings, you may want to use the following to set a PYTHONPATH:

```sh
export PYTHONPATH=".:../:.:src:../:../../:.:prompt-lib"
```

## Getting Started with Acronym Generation


```sh
python -u src/acronym/run.py "Using language models of code for few-shot commonsense"
```

* Since we sample with temperature 0.7, you'll get different results each time you run the above command.




```swift
0 INIT> Using language models of code for few-shot commonsense

0 GEN> CLoCK
0 SCORES> * Ease of pronunciation: CLoCK is pronounced "clah-k". This is easy acronym to pronounce. 4/5 
* Ease of spelling: CLoCK is easy to spell. 5/5 
* Relation to title: CLoCK stands for "Code Language Models of Commonsense Knowledge" which is related to the title. 5/5 
* Positive connotation: CLoCK is a positive acronym. It implies accuracy and efficiency. 5/5

## Dialogue Response Generation

```sh
PYTHONPATH="." python -u src/responsegen/run.py --output <OUTPUT FILE> --size <DATA SIZE>
```

- Use size 0 for running on all test instances

<hr>


## Code Readability Improvement


* Note: Please unzip 'data/tasks/codeclean/code_readability/codenet-python-train.jsonl.zip' before running the following commands!

- Running:
```sh
PYTHONPATH="." python -u src/readability/readability.py --output <OUTPUT FILE>
```

- Evaluation:
```sh
PYTHONPATH="." python -u src/readability/{count_comment|count_function|count_meaningful_var}.py --file <INPUT FILE>
```


<hr>


## Commongen

* We use a hard version of commongen. The data is located in `data/prompts/commongen`. You can download the data by running the following commands:

```sh
python -u src/commongen/run.py cmd stair bubble team dryer puppy aliens cat 
```

<hr>


## GSM-8k


- To run the GSM-8k task:

```sh
python -u src/gsm/run.py 
```

- The outputs will be saved in `data/tasks/gsm/gsm_outputs.jsonl`


- To evaluate the outputs:

```sh
python src/gsm/gsm_selfref_eval.py --path  data/tasks/gsm/gsm_outputs.jsonl
```

- The evaluation script will also generate a report (`data/tasks/gsm/gsm_outputs.jsonl.reports.txt`) showing examples of wrong generations, feedback, and refined feedback generations.

<hr>


## General setup

* Each task has three different types of prompts:

1. `Init`: used to initialize the task. This is how the initial output is generated.

2. `Feedback`: used to get feedback from the model on the intermediate results.

3. `Iterate`: used to get the next iteration from the model, based on the feedback.

* Every task has a `run.py` that initializes the prompts and runs the task.

* As an example, the prompts for commongen are as follows:

1. Init prompt:

```sh
python src/commongen/task_init.py
```

2. Feedback prompt:

```sh
 python src/commongen/feedback.py
```

3. Iterate prompt:

```sh
python src/commongen/task_iterate.py
```

You can also see these prompts on our [website](https://selfrefine.info).
